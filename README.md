# Snake
Software for Snake game üêç

Snake is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that continuously moves across the screen. The main goal is to eat food (usually represented as small squares) to grow the snake and increase the score while avoiding collisions with walls or its own body.

### Controls:
 - Up Arrow: Move up.
 - Down Arrow: Move down.
 - Left Arrow: Move left.
 - Right Arrow: Move right.

### Objectives:
 - Collect Food: Guide the snake to eat food that appears randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer.
 - Avoid Collisions: Do not run into the walls or the snake's body. Hitting either will end the game.
 - Score Points: Each piece of food eaten adds to the player's score, aiming for the highest score possible.
